   <p>I don't think you can fully describe a person with few words. I just try to get things right. I am a movie enthusiast and I really like the weeknd. I hope this country becomes better someday and when I'm successful, I'd like to help people in poor communities</p>
   <p>My favorite quote is. I do not have a favorite quote. I d like the Marquis from John Wick 4. He did say a lot of good things</p>
   <br>
